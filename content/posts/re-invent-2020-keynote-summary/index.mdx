### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) Public

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, share,and deploy your container images and artifacts anywhere. Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate your owncontainer repositories or worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure. Amazon ECR hosts your images in a highlyavailable and high-performance architecture, allowing you to reliably deploy images for your container applications. Youcan share container software privately within your organization or publicly worldwide for anyone to discover anddownload.

#### Use Cases: 

1. NEW: Public container image and artifact gallery: You can discover and use container software that vendors, open source projects and community developers sharepublicly inthe Amazon ECR public gallery. Popular base images such as operating systems, AWS-published images,Kubernetes add-ons and files such as Helm charts can be found in the gallery. 
2. Team and public collaboration: Amazon ECR supports the ability to define and organize repositories in your registry using namespaces. This allows you to organize your repositories based on your team’s existing workflows. You can set which API actions another user mayperform on your repository (e.g., create, list, describe, delete, and get) through resource-level policies, allowing you toeasily share your repositories with different users and AWS accounts, or publicly with anyone in the world.

#### Customer Benefits: 

1. Reduce your effort with a fully managed registry: Amazon Elastic Container Registry eliminates the need to operate and scale the infrastructure required to power your container registry. There is no software to install and manage or infrastructure to scale. Just push your container images to Amazon ECR and pull the imagesusing any container management tool when you need to deploy.
2. Securely share and download container images Amazon Elastic Container Registry transfers your container images over HTTPS and automatically encrypts your images at rest. You can configure policies to manage permissions and control access to your images using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and roles without having to manage credentials directly on your EC2 instances.
3. Provide fast and highly available access: Amazon Elastic Container Registry has a highly scalable, redundant, and durable architecture. Your container images are highly available and accessible, allowing you to reliably deploy new containers for your applications. You can reliably distribute public container images as well as related files such as helm charts and policy configurations for use by any developer. ECR automatically replicates container software to multiple AWS Regions to reduce download times and improve availability.

### AWS Proton

## AI/ML

### Amazon SageMaker Pipelines 

Amazon SageMaker Pipelines is the world’s first machine learning (ML) CI/CD service accessible to every developer and data scientist.SageMakerPipelines brings CI/CD practices to ML reducing the months of coding required to manually stitch together different code packages to just a few hours.ML workflows are typically out of reach for all but the largest enterprises, because they are hard to build. To build ML workflows, you typicallyneed to create hundreds of code packages for data preparation, model training, and model deployment, and stitch them together so they run asa sequence of steps. The process is tedious and error prone because youneed to define the order of the steps while keeping track ofdependencies between each step, making it slow and difficult to scale model production.With just a few clicks in SageMaker Pipelines, you can create an automated machine learning workflow. SageMaker Pipelines takes care of all the heavy lifting involved with managing the dependencies between each step of the workflow and orchestrates them so you can scale tothousands of models in production and expand your use of machine learning across more lines of business

#### Availability:

Amazon SageMaker Pipelinesis available in all AWS Regions where SageMaker is available. See details on the AWS Regions Table

#### Use Cases: 
1. Workflowsare required for all machine learning applications, so Amazon SageMaker Pipelinescan be used for all ML use cases.

#### Customer Benefits: 

1. Compose and manage ML workflows: Amazon SageMaker Pipelines enables you to build an automated sequence of steps to move models from concept to production. You can buildevery step of the ML lifecycle with an easy to use Python interface for creating pipelines to develop and deploy models, automate the processthrough built-in CI/CD templates, and monitor the pipelines using SageMaker Studio. You can also manage the dependencies between eachstep, build the correct sequence, and execute the steps automatically, reducing months of coding to a few hours.
2. Scale workflows to thousands of models:  Amazon SageMaker Pipelines automatically tracks code, datasets, and model versions through each step of the machine learning lifecycle. This enables you to go back and replay model generation steps, troubleshoot problems, and reliably track the lineage of models at scale, acrossthousands of models in production.
3. Track and access model versions in a model registry: You can have hundreds of machine learning workflows in your business, each with a different version of the same model, which makes trackingmodel versions tedious and time-consuming. To help you track versions, Amazon SageMaker Pipelines provides a central repository of trainedmodels called a model registry. You can access the model registry through SageMaker Studio or programmatically throughthe Python SDK making it easy to deploy your models you are responsible for, across development and production


### Amazon SageMakerData Wrangler

SageMaker Data Wrangler takes the tedium out of preparing training data by allowing data scientists and ML engineers to analyze and prepare data for machine learning applications from a single interface. Instead of requiring complex queries to collect data from different sources,SageMaker Data Wrangler connects to data sources with just a few clicks. Its ready-to-use visualization templates and built-in data transformsstreamline the process of cleaning, verifying, and exploring data so you can produce accurate ML models without writing a single line of code.Once your training data is prepared, you can automate data preparation and, through integration with SageMaker Pipelines, add it as a step intoyour ML workflow

#### Availability:

1. Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangleris available in all AWS Regions where SageMaker Studio is available. See details on the AWS Regions Table

#### Use Cases: 
1. Cleanse & Explore Your Data: Data scientists need to collect data in various formats from different sources, which requires creating complex queries and using import tools toload the data into a data preparation environment. The data selection tool in Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler makes it easy to select andquery data from one of several data sources. Once data is imported, you can view statistics and access a suite of built-in data transformsdesigned to reduce tedious tasks such as data cleansing and exploration. 
2. Visualize & Understand Your Data: SageMaker Data Wrangler provides a set of visualization templates, such ashistograms, scatter plots, and box and whisker plots, so you can quickly detect outliers or extreme values within a data set without the need towrite code. You can also use ML model report capabilities to gain an understanding of important columns in your data set, and proactivelyidentify potential inconsistencies in the data preparation workflow. 
3. Enrich Your Data: Data scientists must use feature engineering to transform data into a format that can be used to build an accurate ML model. SageMaker DataWrangler provides pre-configured data transformation tools so you can easily perform feature engineering. Within SageMaker Data Wrangler, you can also identify imbalancein datasets and spot potential bias in training data
